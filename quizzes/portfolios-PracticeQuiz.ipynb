"# Some good things to reference\n",
"\n",
"[Anonymous Records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/anonymous-records#syntax). You can read the above link for details, but the point of these is quite simple.\n",
"\n",
"Records have been our main type for holding data for an observation. We\u0027ve typically defined these ahead of time with a name before using them. This is good for important types that you will use frequently.\n",
"\n",
"If you\u0027re using a particular record in only a few lines of code, then it can feel cumbersome to define the type beforehand. Anonymous records are a good solution in these circumstances. They are records that you can essentially use like regular records that we\u0027ve been using, but you don\u0027t have to define the name of the record ahead of time.\n",
"\n",
"I rarely use anonymous records, but you might find them useful for exploratory data manipulation. They\u0027re also kind of nice for these short problems because I don\u0027t need to define a record for each problem.\n",
"\n",
"# Anonymous records\n",

"## Question 1\n",
"\n",
"1. Create a *record* named `ExampleRec` that has an `X` field of type int and a `Y` field of type int. Create an example `ExampleRec` and assign it to a value named `r`.\n",
"2. Create an *anonymous record* that has an `X` field of type int and a `Y` field of type int. Create an example of the anonymous record and assign it to a value named `ar`.\n",
